# iPhone 6 Template

![iPhone 6 Template Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nagelflorian/iPhone6-Template/screenshots/iPhone6-Template.png)

My personal multi-purpose Illustrator iPhone 6 template free for you to use.

**License:** Of course you can use this template for commercial work. But please do not repurpose the file or any of its elements as your own. It shouldn't be broken apart and used to create similar tools.

##What's inside
The Adobe Illustrator File (CC 2014) includes a well structured library of commonly used iOS UI elements such as status and navigation bars plus various assets for wireframing. The template screen size is 750 x 1334 pixel - e.g. the actual iPhone 6 screen size. That means you can export the screens to other applications or see them 1:1 on a real device.

##Getting started
Before you get started, I recommend having a look at the official [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH12-SW1) from Apple. For a brief overview on wireframing I recommend [Dana Larson's guide on Wireframing](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/learning-to-wireframe-10-best-practices).

There are a couple of ways to download this template:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/nagelflorian/iPhone6-Template/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nagelflorian/iPhone6-Template.git`

**Some tips when using the template:**

- make sure you always have "Align to Pixel Grid" checked for a pixel-perfect design
- seperate elements by using the given layer structure
- use color and text sparingly
